This is a test for traefik ingress from <https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/crd-acme/>.

Test the manifests build with `kubectl kustomize ./tenants/test-ingress/envs/dev`.

The `dev` test workload uses a TLS certificate self-signed by `cert-manager`. It should look different to the default one generated by Traefik (it should no longer state it is `TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT`).

This workload also tests that it is possible to make a Persistent Volume Claim from Longhorn.
