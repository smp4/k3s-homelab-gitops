# Dynamic environment promotion

TODO

[Use dynamic environments for staging](https://codefresh.io/blog/kubernetes-antipatterns-2/). Create it with a namespace of its own, eg feature-a.staging.apps.cluster-name.domain.

As of [October 2023](https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps/issues/57#issuecomment-1755571477), there isn't a ArgoCD guide for how to manage environments with AppSets.
