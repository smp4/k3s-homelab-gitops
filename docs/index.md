> A basic, unavoidably opinionated, non-professional template for bootstrapping a K3S cluster at home using a GitOps approach.

This repo is a basic, unavoidably opinionated, non-professional template for bootstrapping a K3S cluster at home using a GitOps approach.

This is the public version of the GitOps infrastructure repository for my home cluster. It is intended to be used as a template for a new cluster, and then to be forked and modified to suit your needs. 

:warning: **Use at your own risk! This template attempts, but does not guarantee, to follow configuration and security best practices. It was not created by a kubernetes professional. I am not responsible for any damages or data loss incurred by your usage of this template.** :warning:
