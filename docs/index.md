# K3S Homelab Gitops Documentation

> A basic, unavoidably opinionated, non-professional template for bootstrapping a K3S cluster at home using a GitOps approach.

This repo is a basic, unavoidably opinionated, non-professional template for bootstrapping a K3S cluster at home using a GitOps approach.

This is the public version of the GitOps infrastructure repository for my home cluster. It is intended to be used as a template for a new cluster, and then to be forked and modified to suit your needs.
